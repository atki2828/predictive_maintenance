# Predictive Maintenance App

![Streamlit App Demo](good_demo.gif)

## Overview
This project demonstrates how **Survival Regression** can be applied to predictive maintenance on a fleet of machines using real telemetry data. Instead of relying on black box deep learning approaches, I used the **Cox Proportional Hazards Model with time-varying covariates** (via the [lifelines](https://lifelines.readthedocs.io/) package) to estimate machine component failure probability 2 days ahead.

The dataset comes from the **Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance** sample, which includes telemetry, error logs, and maintenance records for a fleet of machines. The model predicts **failure probabilities** for individual components, allowing maintenance teams to **prioritize inspections and repairs** in a data driven way.

The Streamlit app provides:
- A **ranked list of machines/components** at highest risk of failure.
- Interactive **visualizations** for failure probabilities and machine health.
- A **drill down view** for individual components and historical context.
