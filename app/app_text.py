### A Statistical Approach Using Survival Regression      
In the realm of practical **predictive maintenance** use cases, it's tempting for data teams to jump straight into **deep learning models**. But recently, I’ve been working with the **Cox Proportional Hazards model with time-varying covariates** from the `lifelines` python package, and have discovered it can be an excellent choice on any predictive maintenance use case that entails incorporating telemetry **IoT** signals. It’s interpretable, efficient, and importantly, already familiar to many reliability and quality engineers.

This `streamlit` app explores that alternative using the Azure Predictive Maintenance dataset to show how a **Cox PH** model can be developed and deployed in a real-world scenario to support smarter maintenance decisions.

I will demonstrate how to extend the **Cox PH** approach with time-varying covariates to model the **probability of a component failure within the next 2 days** as a sample use case. This example illustrates how maintenance teams can leverage these tools to prioritize their work more effectively based on dynamic risk estimates and incorporating ever changing **telemetry data**.


Before diving in, here’s why I think this modeling approach is so well-suited for predictive maintenance:

✅ Combines static attributes (e.g., manufacturer, install date) with real-time telemetry from sensors   
✅ Easily integrated into production pipelines using Python and open-source tools like lifelines   
✅ Can yield failure probabilities with a bit of post-processing   
✅ Naturally handles class imbalance and censored data, both common in real-world maintenance settings   
✅ Bridges the gap between data science teams and reliability engineers who already use these models in tools like JMP or Minitab as Lifelines now scalable and automatable in Python
