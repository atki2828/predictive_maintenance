### A Statistical Approach Using Survival Regression      
In the realm of practical **predictive maintenance** use cases, it's tempting for data teams to jump straight into **deep learning models**. But recently, I‚Äôve been working with the **Cox Proportional Hazards model with time-varying covariates** from the `lifelines` python package, and have discovered it can be an excellent choice on any predictive maintenance use case that entails incorporating telemetry **IoT** signals. It‚Äôs interpretable, efficient, and importantly, already familiar to many reliability and quality engineers.

This `streamlit` app explores that alternative using the Azure Predictive Maintenance dataset to show how a **Cox PH** model can be developed and deployed in a real-world scenario to support smarter maintenance decisions.

I will demonstrate how to extend the **Cox PH** approach with time-varying covariates to model the **probability of a component failure within the next 2 days** as a sample use case. This example illustrates how maintenance teams can leverage these tools to prioritize their work more effectively based on dynamic risk estimates and incorporating ever changing **telemetry data**.


Before diving in, here‚Äôs why I think this modeling approach is so well-suited for predictive maintenance:

‚úÖ Combines static attributes (e.g., manufacturer, install date) with real-time telemetry from sensors   
‚úÖ Easily integrated into production pipelines using Python and open-source tools like lifelines   
‚úÖ Can yield failure probabilities with a bit of post-processing   
‚úÖ Naturally handles class imbalance and censored data, both common in real-world maintenance settings   
‚úÖ Bridges the gap between data science teams and reliability engineers who already use these models in tools like JMP or Minitab as Lifelines now scalable and automatable in Python
